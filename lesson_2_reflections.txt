What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Metadata files are added. The files are needed for their information.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area only has what will be commited. This way I can have files I'm not ready to commit (or will never commit) separate from the files I want to commit. I can commit things logically grouped together this way.
